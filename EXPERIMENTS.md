# Experiment Log: Screenshot → HTML/CSS RL Training

## Experiment 1: Proof of Concept (Qwen3.5-4B, Pixel Reward)

**Goal:** Get RL training working end-to-end on Tinker.

### Setup
- **Model:** Qwen3.5-4B (smallest available, fast iteration)
- **Dataset:** 175 synthetic HTML snippets (colored divs, buttons, headings, simple layouts) rendered via Playwright
- **Loss:** GRPO + importance sampling
- **Group size:** 4 rollouts per prompt
- **LR:** 4e-5
- **Max tokens:** 512

### Reward Function v1: Pixel-only (SSIM + MSE)
```
reward = 0.6 * pixel_mse_score + 0.4 * ssim_score
# Computed on content-cropped region to avoid white-space domination
# Scaled to [-1, 1]
```

**Problem:** SSIM was dominated by white backgrounds — a red button vs blue button scored ~0.95 because 90% of pixels are identical white.

**Fix:** Crop to content bounding box before comparison. This spread the scores:
- Perfect match: 1.0
- Wrong color: 0.43
- Totally wrong: -0.41

### Results
- **Training:** 21 batches, reward went from -0.32 → +0.45 over ~25 minutes
- **Outcome:** Model clearly learned to produce HTML matching screenshots. Proved the pipeline works.

### Key Decisions
- Disabled thinking mode (`qwen3_5_disable_thinking`) — the model was spending all tokens on chain-of-thought instead of generating HTML
- Started with synthetic data (colored boxes) for simplicity, then switched to WebSight for real websites

---

## Experiment 2: Scaling Up (Qwen3.5-4B, WebSight, PPO)

**Goal:** Train on real website data with better RL algorithms.

### Setup Changes
- **Dataset:** 254 WebSight v0.1 examples (realistic synthetic websites with inline CSS)
- **Loss:** GRPO + PPO (clipped ratio [0.8, 1.2]) — prevents large policy jumps
- **KL penalty:** β=0.05 — prevents mode collapse
- **Group size:** 8 (up from 4) — better advantage estimates
- **Checkpoints:** Every 10 batches via `training_client.save_state()`

### Reward Function v2: Same pixel-only (SSIM + MSE)
```
reward = 0.2 * pixel_mse_score + 0.8 * ssim_score
# Content-cropped, scaled to [-1, 1]
```

### Results
- **Training:** 31 batches, reward from ~0.3 → 0.67
- **Eval (base vs RL):** Base avg 0.252, RL avg 0.332, improvement +0.080, RL wins 6/10
- **KL:** Converged from 0.162 → 0.015 (model became confident without collapsing)
- **No skipped batches** — GROUP_SIZE=8 always produced variance for advantages

### Key Decisions
- PPO clipping stabilized training vs raw importance sampling
- KL penalty prevented reward hacking
- GROUP_SIZE=8 eliminated the "all same reward" skip problem from GROUP_SIZE=4

---

## Experiment 3: Multi-Signal Reward, Larger Model (Qwen3.5-27B)

**Goal:** Better reward function covering text, color, layout, not just pixels. Bigger model.

### Setup Changes
- **Model:** Qwen3.5-27B (7x capacity)
- **Dataset:** 974 WebSight v0.2 + 483 Design2Code (1457 total)
- **Max tokens:** 1024
- **LR:** 4e-5 (same as 4B — too high for 27B)

### Reward Function v3: 8-signal DOM-based
```
reward = weighted sum of:
  0.20 * block_position    (IoU of matched DOM elements via querySelectorAll('*'))
  0.20 * text_content      (per-block fuzzy string match)
  0.10 * bg_color_match    (per-block RGB distance)
  0.05 * text_color_match  (per-block RGB distance)
  0.05 * font_family_match (exact match)
  0.05 * font_size_match   (ratio-based)
  0.20 * clip_similarity   (CLIP ViT-B-32 cosine similarity)
  0.15 * visual_ssim       (pixel SSIM+MSE on content crop)
```

### Problems
1. **Reward was too noisy** — 8 signals pulled in different directions. GRPO couldn't find a clean gradient.
2. **DOM block matching was too strict** — `querySelectorAll('*')` matched every wrapper div. 80 ref blocks vs 40 gen blocks → `match_ratio=0.5` killed all DOM scores by 50%, even when the page looked correct.
3. **Design2Code pages too complex** — full real websites can't be reproduced in 1024 tokens. Added noise to training.
4. **LR too high for 27B** — caused oscillation instead of steady improvement.

### Results
- **Training:** 182 batches (~7 hours), reward oscillated between -0.25 and +0.07
- **20-batch averages** showed the reward actually got *worse* mid-training (batch 81-100: -0.212) then partially recovered
- **Eval:** Base 0.308, RL 0.340, improvement only +0.032. RL wins 6/10.

### Diagnosis
The reward landscape was not smoothly climbable. Small DOM mismatches (extra wrapper divs, different nesting) caused cliff-edge score drops even when the visual output was correct. The model couldn't tell what direction to move.

---

## Experiment 4: Smooth Reward, Tuned Hyperparams (In Progress)

**Goal:** Fix the reward to be smoothly climbable. Each signal should degrade gracefully.

### Setup Changes
- **LR:** 1e-5 (4x lower, appropriate for 27B)
- **Max tokens:** 2048 (let model generate complex pages)
- **Dataset:** WebSight only (removed Design2Code from training, kept for eval)

### Reward Function v4: 5-signal, globally smooth
```
reward = weighted sum of:
  0.25 * clip_similarity     (CLIP ViT-B-32, perceptual anchor)
  0.25 * global_text_match   (ALL visible text compared via SequenceMatcher — not per-block)
  0.20 * layout_score        (meaningful elements only, soft count penalty)
  0.15 * color_palette_match (quantized color histogram overlap — not per-block)
  0.15 * visual_ssim         (pixel SSIM+MSE on content crop)
```

### Key Changes from v3

| Problem in v3 | Fix in v4 |
|---|---|
| `querySelectorAll('*')` matched every div | Filter to meaningful tags only (h1-h6, p, nav, button, etc.) + elements with text/bg color |
| `match_ratio` multiplier killed scores | Soft count penalty: `0.5 + 0.5 * count_ratio` (ranges 0.5-1.0 instead of 0.0-1.0) |
| Per-block text matching inherited block matching noise | Global text comparison — extract ALL visible text, fuzzy match as one string |
| Per-block color matching was noisy | Color palette comparison — quantize colors, compare histograms |
| 8 signals too many, contradictory gradients | 5 signals, each independently smooth |

### Reward Behavior (tested)
```
Perfect match:    +1.000  [all signals 1.0]
Wrong nav color:  +0.839  [text/layout stay 1.0, color/clip drop slightly]
Wrong text:       +0.690  [text drops 0.85, CLIP 0.57, layout stays 1.0]
Missing nav:      +0.385  [layout drops 0.44, everything degrades gracefully]
Extra elements:   +0.761  [small layout penalty, not over-punished]
Slightly off:     +0.802  [smooth gradient toward perfect]
```

No cliff edges. Each error type degrades the right signals without killing the whole score.

### Results (4-batch smoke test)
- **Training:** 4 batches, reward 0.058 → 0.190
- **Eval:** Base 0.231, RL 0.200, improvement -0.031, RL wins 5/10
- **Assessment:** Essentially tied after 4 batches. Reward is smooth and climbable (all positive, no -1.0 catastrophes) but model needs more training time to separate from base.

---

## Experiment 5: Tall Screenshots (512x1536 Viewport)

**Goal:** Show the model full page content instead of cutting off at 512px.

### Setup Changes
- **Viewport:** 512x1536 (3x taller) — shows nav, hero, body, footer
- **Everything else same as Experiment 4**

### Key Insight
The model was being asked to reproduce content it couldn't see. With 512x512 viewport, most pages were cut off — the reference HTML had sections below the fold that never appeared in the screenshot. The model was penalized for content it literally had no visual signal for.

### Results (8-batch run)
- **Training:** 8 batches, reward 0.116 → 0.145 (consistently positive)
- **Eval:** Base 0.586, RL 0.585, improvement -0.000, RL wins 6/10
- **Absolute scores jumped massively** — base went from 0.231 → 0.586 just from showing more content. The model was already decent; it just couldn't see the full page before.

### Assessment
The tall viewport was the single biggest improvement to absolute quality. RL essentially tied with base after 8 batches but won 6/10 matchups — needs more training to compound.

---

## Experiment 6: Desktop Viewport + Curriculum (In Progress)

**Goal:** Natural desktop layout (1024x768), curriculum learning (easy→hard), include Design2Code pages.

### Setup Changes
- **Viewport:** 1024x768 (standard desktop, proper horizontal layout)
- **Dataset:** 974 WebSight + 37 Design2Code (<8K chars) = 1011 examples
- **Curriculum:** Dataset sorted by HTML length — shortest pages first, longest last. Model learns simple layouts (nav + heading) before complex ones (multi-section pages with forms, cards, etc.)
- **MAX_TOKENS:** 4096 (up from 2048, supports longer D2C pages)
- **LR:** 1e-5
- **Design2Code** filtered to pages <8K chars (37 of 483 qualify) — the rest are 60K+ chars and can't be generated in 4096 tokens

### Why Curriculum
Without curriculum, the model sees a random mix of easy and hard pages. It wastes gradient signal on hard pages it can't solve yet, while also not spending enough time on easy pages to nail the fundamentals. With curriculum:
- Batches 0-28: WebSight pages (447-2000 chars) — learn basic HTML structure, colors, fonts
- Batches 29-30: Design2Code pages (4000-8000 chars) — apply skills to real websites

### Why 1024x768
The 512px width was squishing layouts into a single column. Real websites are designed for 1024-1440px width — nav bars should be horizontal, content should use the full width, sidebars should be visible. At 1024px the model sees the intended layout, not a mobile-like rendering.

### Status
Running 30-batch curriculum training. 1011 examples, checkpoint at batch 15, auto-eval at the end.

### Reward Function (v4 with CLIP)
```
0.25 * CLIP perceptual similarity
0.25 * global text match (SequenceMatcher on all visible text)
0.20 * layout score (meaningful DOM elements, soft count penalty)
0.15 * color palette similarity (quantized histogram overlap)
0.15 * visual SSIM+MSE (content-cropped)
```

### Results (30 batches)
- **Training:** reward climbed to 0.36 by batch 29, KL dropped to 0.021
- **Eval:** Base 0.248, RL 0.197, improvement -0.050, RL wins 5/10
- **Assessment:** Training reward looked great but didn't transfer to eval. The model optimized the training reward but didn't generalize to held-out examples. Possible cause: CLIP added noise to the gradient signal, or train/eval mismatch from stale dataset screenshots.

---

## Experiment 7: Optimized Pure-DOM Reward ✓ BEST RESULT

**Goal:** Faster, cleaner reward — drop CLIP model, cache reference extraction, single JS call.

### Setup
- Same as Experiment 6 (1024x768, curriculum, 1011 examples, 30 batches)
- **LR:** 1e-5
- **MAX_TOKENS:** 4096

### Reward Function v5: Pure DOM, no model inference
```
0.30 * global text match (SequenceMatcher on all visible text)
0.30 * layout score (meaningful DOM elements, soft count penalty)
0.20 * color palette similarity (quantized histogram overlap)
0.20 * visual SSIM+MSE (content-cropped)
```

### Key Optimizations
1. **Dropped CLIP** — DOM comparison is faster and more precise than a 400M parameter model approximating what `getComputedStyle()` gives you exactly
2. **Cached reference extraction** — ref DOM extracted once per prompt, reused across all 8 rollouts (was redundantly extracted 8x)
3. **Single JS evaluate** — combined text + blocks + colors into one `page.evaluate()` call (was 3 separate round-trips)
4. **Gen HTML rendered once** — DOM extraction + screenshot in same page load (was rendering twice)

### Results (30 batches)
- **Training:** reward 0.085 → 0.328, KL 0.091 → 0.022
- **Eval:** Base 0.106, RL 0.187, **improvement +0.082, RL wins 7/10**
- **Per-example:** 5 examples with delta > +0.13 (layout fidelity clearly improved)
- **Assessment:** Best result so far. Pure DOM reward without CLIP produces cleaner gradients. The model learned better layout matching, color accuracy, and text reproduction.

---

## Experiment 8: Tailwind Prompt + Live Ref Render (Smoke Test)

**Goal:** Fix two issues discovered during analysis:
1. WebSight v0.2 uses Tailwind CSS but system prompt told model to use inline CSS
2. Model input was stale dataset screenshot, not live-rendered HTML (mismatch with reward)

### Key Findings
- **All 974 WebSight v0.2 examples use Tailwind via CDN** — model was forced to reverse-engineer Tailwind utilities into inline CSS (unnecessary translation step)
- **DOM reward is style-agnostic** — `getComputedStyle()` returns the same values whether from Tailwind class or inline CSS, so reward already handles this correctly
- **Input mismatch** — model saw pre-rendered dataset screenshot but reward compared against live Playwright render

### Changes
- **System prompt** updated: "You may use Tailwind CSS, inline styles, or a `<style>` block"
- **render_html()** waits for `networkidle` (ensures Tailwind CDN loads) instead of fixed 100ms
- **Model input** now uses live-rendered HTML via Playwright (consistent with reward)

### Results (4-batch smoke test)
- **Training:** reward -0.047 → 0.275 (strong climb in just 4 batches)
- **Eval:** Base 0.104, RL 0.189, **improvement +0.085, RL wins 2/5**
- **RL model much more consistent** — std 0.066 vs base 0.172
- **Assessment:** Similar improvement to Exp 7 with only 4 batches. Tailwind-aware prompt + live ref render is working. Ready for a longer run.

## Results Summary

| Exp | Model | Batches | Reward Fn | Eval Improvement | RL Wins |
|-----|-------|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| 1 | 4B | 21 | Pixel SSIM+MSE | N/A (no formal eval) | N/A |
| 2 | 4B | 31 | Pixel SSIM+MSE | +0.080 | 6/10 |
| 3 | 27B | 182 | 8-signal DOM+CLIP | +0.032 | 6/10 |
| 4 | 27B | 4 | 5-signal smooth | -0.031 | 5/10 |
| 5 | 27B | 8 | 5-signal, tall viewport | -0.000 | 6/10 |
| 6 | 27B | 30 | 5-signal+CLIP, 1024x768 | -0.050 | 5/10 |
| **7** | **27B** | **30** | **Pure DOM (no CLIP)** | **+0.082** | **7/10** |
| 8 | 27B | 4 | Pure DOM+Tailwind+live ref | +0.085 | 2/5 |
| **9** | **27B** | **90** | **All improvements combined** | **+0.231** | **9/10** |

### Key Learnings
1. **CLIP hurts more than it helps** — adds noise to gradients, DOM comparison is strictly better
2. **Pure DOM reward works** — text match + layout match + color match gives clean, actionable signal
3. **Viewport matters** — 1024x768 shows natural desktop layouts
4. **Tailwind awareness** — letting the model use Tailwind (matching the training data) removes an unnecessary translation burden
5. **Live ref rendering** — ensures model input matches reward comparison
6. **More batches = more improvement** — exp 9 at 75 batches showed 3x the improvement of exp 7 at 30 batches
7. **Curriculum ordering works** — sorting easy→hard lets the model build up skills progressively

---

## Experiment 9: Full Run ✓ BEST RESULT

**Goal:** Scale up Experiment 8 to 90+ batches with all improvements combined.

### Setup
- All Exp 8 changes (Tailwind prompt, live ref render, networkidle, pure DOM reward)
- **90 batches** (stopped at batch-90 checkpoint, originally planned 105)
- **1011 examples** (974 WebSight v0.2 + 37 Design2Code <8K chars), curriculum-ordered
- Qwen3.5-27B, LR 1e-5, GROUP_SIZE 8, PPO clip [0.8, 1.2], KL_BETA 0.05
- 1024x768 viewport, MAX_TOKENS 4096
- Checkpoints every 15 batches

### Reward Function v5 (pure DOM, no model inference)
```
0.30 * global text match (SequenceMatcher on all visible text)
0.30 * layout score (meaningful DOM elements, IoU matching, soft count penalty)
0.20 * color palette similarity (quantized histogram overlap)
0.20 * visual SSIM+MSE (content-cropped)
```

### Training Trajectory
- **Reward:** started -0.14, settled into 0.1-0.3 range by batch 10, held steady through batch 90
- **KL:** dropped from 0.079 → 0.006 (model converged to confident policy)
- **Batch times:** 110-140s after warmup (~2 min/batch)
- **Curriculum:** easy WebSight pages first (447 chars), harder pages later (up to 7870 chars)

### Checkpoint Evals

| Checkpoint | Base Avg | RL Avg | Improvement | RL Wins |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| Batch 60 | 0.013 | 0.275 | **+0.263** | 9/10 |
| Batch 75 | 0.034 | 0.265 | **+0.231** | 9/10 |

### Per-Example Results (Batch 75)
```
 1: base=0.061  rl=0.141  delta=+0.079
 2: base=0.016  rl=0.151  delta=+0.135
 3: base=0.231  rl=0.429  delta=+0.199
 4: base=0.221  rl=0.256  delta=+0.035
 5: base=0.124  rl=0.410  delta=+0.286
 6: base=-0.274  rl=-0.279  delta=-0.005  (only loss, essentially tied)
 7: base=-0.477  rl=0.272  delta=+0.749  (biggest win)
 8: base=0.228  rl=0.203  delta=-0.025
 9: base=0.257  rl=0.441  delta=+0.184
10: base=0.155  rl=0.623  delta=+0.469
```

### Assessment
Best result by a wide margin. 3x improvement over exp 7. The combination of all changes compounds:
- Pure DOM reward (no CLIP noise)
- Tailwind-aware prompt (no unnecessary style translation)
- Live ref rendering (consistent input/reward)
- More batches (90 vs 30 — more unique examples seen)
- Curriculum (easy→hard progression)

The RL model consistently produces better layout structure, more accurate text content, and closer color matching than the base 27B model. The model has seen ~720 unique training examples (90 batches × 8 prompts) out of 1011 available.

### Notes
- Some WebSight examples reference external images (Unsplash URLs) that don't load — renders blank. Affects ~1-2% of examples. Could filter in future.
- KL_BETA 0.05 was too high — KL dropped to 0.006 meaning the penalty was barely active. Lowered default to 0.02 for future runs.

---

## Experiment 10: Overnight Run — More Data, Improved Reward ✓ BEST RESULT

**Goal:** Resume from exp 9 batch-90 checkpoint, train 200 more batches on 3x the data with improved reward.

### Setup
- **Resumed from** exp 9 batch-90 checkpoint
- **200 batches** (~1600 unique examples)
- **2983 examples** (2893 WebSight v0.2 + 90 Design2Code <16K chars)
- KL_BETA lowered to 0.02
- MAX_TOKENS 8192, MAX_HTML_CHARS 16000

### Reward Function v6
```
0.20 * global text match (SequenceMatcher on all visible text)
0.15 * styled text match (text + font size/weight/color per element)
0.25 * layout score (size similarity + relative ordering, tag-weighted)
0.20 * color palette similarity (quantized histogram)
0.20 * visual SSIM+MSE
```

Changes from v5:
- **Styled text signal** — matches text blocks by content, then scores font size ratio, font weight match, text color similarity
- **Relative ordering** in layout — compares element sizes + vertical order instead of absolute bounding box positions (robust to cascading offset errors)
- **Tag-weighted layout** — headings, buttons, inputs weighted higher than generic divs
- **Invisible element filtering** — skips `display:none`, `visibility:hidden`, `opacity:0`
- **Block dedup disabled** — was too aggressive, removed content-bearing elements

### Results
- **Training:** reward climbed from 0.1 → 0.68 over 200 batches (still climbing at end)
- **Eval:** Base 0.429, RL 0.596, **improvement +0.167, RL wins 8/10**
- **Model path:** `tinker://8d1edefb-7b10-5af2-b378-c470421d4982:train:0/sampler_weights/prox-final`

### Observations
- RL model produces correct text content and layout structure
- **Weakness:** buttons and styled elements lose their visual styling (colors, border-radius, padding). Model outputs minimal unstyled buttons instead of matching the reference styling
- **Root cause:** reward weights text/layout heavily but element-level styling (button bg color, section bg color) is only captured by the global color palette, which doesn't penalize *which* element lost its color
- **Next:** add per-element background color to styled_text comparison

## Experiment 11: DOM Reward Was Broken — Switch to SSIM-Anchored

**Key finding:** Our complex DOM reward was penalizing visually identical outputs.

GPT-5.4 generated pages with SSIM 0.991 (pixel-perfect) but scored reward -0.5 under our DOM comparison. The DOM signals were detecting "differences" that didn't matter visually — different CSS class names, slightly different nesting depth, Tailwind utilities vs inline CSS.

### The Fix
Replaced the 5-signal DOM reward with a simple SSIM-anchored formula:
```
reward = 0.60 * SSIM + 0.25 * text_match + 0.15 * color_match
```

If it looks right visually, it IS right. Text and color are bonuses, not vetoes.

### Before vs After (same GPT-5.4 outputs, same examples)
```
Old DOM reward:  avg 0.391  (punished pixel-perfect pages)
SSIM reward:     avg 0.602  (rewards what actually matters)
```

---

## Experiment 12: Multi-Turn Agent with Analyze-Then-Fix

**Key finding:** Splitting "look at the diff" and "fix the code" into two steps works much better than doing both at once.

### Approach
Each turn is now two steps:
1. **Analyze**: model sees the diff image, lists what's wrong ("nav background is missing, heading too large, button has no border-radius")
2. **Fix**: model fixes based on its own analysis

### GPT-5.4 Results — Analyze-Fix vs Naive
```
Naive (10 turns):      0.444 → 0.490 → 0.430 (peak turn 5, then REGRESSED)
Analyze-fix (10 turns): 0.442 → 0.520 → 0.509 (held gains, no regression)
Analyze-fix (3 turns):  0.476 → 0.498             (consistent improvement)
```

The analyze step acts as chain-of-thought for visual correction. The model's self-analysis was accurate — "heading too large, line-height too tall, font weight too heavy" — and it fixed progressively.

### GPT-5.4 vs Qwen 4B Baselines (SSIM reward, 10 structured examples)
```
GPT-5.4:        avg 0.602
Qwen 3.5-4B:    avg 0.443
Gap:            0.159
```

### GPT-5.4 on Hard Design2Code (real websites, 7K-121K char source)
```
Avg reward: 0.716
Avg SSIM:   0.906
```

GPT-5.4 crushes hard D2C pages — generates 1-4K chars of simplified HTML that visually matches 100K+ char source pages.

---

## Experiment 13: Full Agent Training (In Progress)

**Goal:** Train Qwen3.5-4B with multi-turn analyze-fix loop to close the gap to GPT-5.4.

### Setup
- **Model:** Qwen3.5-4B
- **Dataset:** 500 WebSight v0.2 + all 483 Design2Code = 983 examples
- **D2C length filter removed** — model generates short HTML regardless of source length
- **100 batches**, 3 turns, analyze-then-fix, GROUP_SIZE=4
- **Reward:** 0.60 SSIM + 0.25 text + 0.15 color
- **TOKENS_PER_TURN:** 4096
- Curriculum ordered (easy WebSight → hard D2C)
- Checkpoints every 20 batches

### Targets
- 4B baseline: 0.443
- GPT-5.4: 0.602
- Gap to close: 0.159

## Part 2: Interactive Flow Evaluation (Mind2Web)

### Setup

Extended the single-screenshot approach to full user flow trajectories. Each task is a sequence of screenshots + actions from real websites (via [Mind2Web](https://huggingface.co/datasets/osunlp/Multimodal-Mind2Web)). The model sees interleaved screenshots and action descriptions, generates interactive HTML/JS, and we execute the actions via Playwright and compare SSIM at each step.

Same multi-turn analyze-fix loop, but the feedback now runs the full action sequence and shows the model which interactions failed.

### Results

Ran on GPT-5.4, Claude Opus 4.6, and Qwen 3.5 (4B/27B):

| Model | Initial SSIM | Generates JS? | Notes |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| GPT-5.4 | 0.68 | Yes (18-22 handlers) | Best visual fidelity |
| Opus 4.6 | 0.40 | Yes (21 handlers, full multi-page app) | Most ambitious code |
| Qwen 27B | 0.24 | No | Static HTML only |
| Qwen 4B | 0.23 | No | Static HTML only |

Frontier models generate genuinely interactive pages with click handlers and state management. Qwen models (both sizes) produce zero JavaScript — this is the gap RL training needs to close.

Found and fixed a harness bug where 74% of clicks weren't firing due to missing CSS selectors. Switched to text-based Playwright matching. Re-evaluating with the fix now.

Running larger experiments overnight.

## Experiment 14: Content-Gated Reward + Blank Page Fix

**Key finding:** Blank pages scored +0.08 reward (positive!) because SSIM between a white page and a mostly-white website is ~0.90. The model could learn to just output nothing.

### The Problem
```
blank page:  0.60 * 0.90 + 0.25 * 0.00 + 0.15 * 0.00 = 0.54  → reward +0.08
mediocre:    0.60 * 0.60 + 0.25 * 0.40 + 0.15 * 0.30 = 0.505 → reward +0.01
```
Blank beats a real attempt. SSIM at 60% weight is so dominant that a blank white page wins against light backgrounds.

### The Fix: Multiplicative Content Gate
```python
content = max(text_match, color_match)
content_gate = 0.2 + 0.8 * content  # 0.2 floor → 1.0 ceiling
gated_ssim = ssim * content_gate
raw = 0.60 * gated_ssim + 0.25 * text + 0.15 * color
```

No hard -1 gates. Smooth gradient everywhere. Results:
- Blank page: reward **-0.78** (was +0.08)
- Mediocre attempt: reward **-0.34** (correctly above blank)
- Good attempt: reward **+0.31**
- Perfect: reward **+1.00**

## Experiment 15: Parallel Rollouts + Tinker Pipelining (6x Speedup)

**Key finding:** Multi-turn training was 50-60 min/batch because turn 2+ processed rollouts **one at a time** (256 sequential blocking calls). Fixed by parallelizing across all rollouts.

### Before (Sequential)
```
Turn 1: parallel (all at once)                    ← FAST
Turn 2: for each of 64 rollouts, sequentially:    ← SLOW
    sample(analyze).result()  # blocks
    sample(fix).result()      # blocks
= 128 sequential Tinker calls, ~55 min/batch
```

### After (Parallel)
```
Turn 1: parallel (all at once)
Turn 2: fire ALL 32 analyze calls → collect all
         fire ALL 32 fix calls → collect all
= 2 parallel batches, ~12 min/batch
```

### Additional Optimizations
- **Pipeline fwd_bwd + optim_step** on same clock cycle (1 cycle vs 3)
- **Overlap training with next batch sampling** (don't wait for training to finish before starting next batch)
- **GROUP_SIZE 8→2** (was wasting 75% of rollouts with zero advantage)

### Timing Results (4B, Mind2Web, 2 turns)

| Config | Time/Batch |
|--------|-----------|
| Old sequential (GS=8, 3 turns) | ~3400s (56 min) |
| Parallel (GS=4, 2 turns, 4K tokens) | 510s (8.5 min) |
| Parallel (GS=2, 2 turns, 8K tokens) | 715s (12 min) |

## Experiment 16: Agent + Flow RL on Mind2Web (In Progress)

**Goal:** Train 4B on real websites (Mind2Web) with all optimizations. Two parallel runs:

### Task 2: Static Screenshot → Multi-Turn Agent
- **Model:** Qwen 3.5-4B
- **Dataset:** Mind2Web landing pages (500 real websites)
- **Training:** BS=16, GS=2, 2 turns (analyze-fix), 8K tokens
- **Reward:** Content-gated SSIM (0.60) + text (0.25) + color (0.15)
- **Parallelism:** All rollouts parallel, pipelined training
- **Status:** Running, batch 0 reward=0.023 → batch 1 reward=0.174

### Task 3: Interactive Flow → Multi-Turn Agent
- **Model:** Qwen 3.5-4B
- **Dataset:** Mind2Web action sequences (500 tasks, 3886 total actions)
- **Training:** BS=16, GS=2, 2 turns, 8K tokens, up to 3 action steps
- **Reward:** Average SSIM across action steps, scaled to [-1, 1]
- **Status:** Running, batch 0 completed in 1928s (32 min), reward=0.023

### Early Agent Eval (2 batches only)
```
Avg SSIM:   0.828
Avg Reward: 0.363
```
Already producing recognizable recreations of real websites after just 64 training examples.

## Key Learnings

1. **SSIM-anchored reward works best** — DOM comparison penalized visually correct outputs. If it looks right, it IS right.

2. **Content gate prevents reward hacking** — blank pages can't ride high SSIM against light backgrounds. Smooth, no hard gates.

3. **Analyze-then-fix > direct fix** — splitting "what's wrong" from "fix it" prevents regression across turns.

4. **Parallelize everything** — sequential rollouts were 6x slower than parallel. Fire all futures, collect later.

5. **Pipeline Tinker calls** — submit fwd_bwd + optim_step together (1 clock cycle vs 3). Start next batch's sampling before current training finishes.

6. **GROUP_SIZE 2-4 is better than 8** — GS=8 wastes 75% of rollouts (zero advantage). GS=2 with more prompts gives better diversity.

7. **Benchmark against frontier models early** — revealed our reward was broken and our harness wasn't clicking buttons.

8. **Models output short code regardless of source complexity** — 1-4K chars of HTML to match 100K+ char source pages.
